# Amulya Veldandi, MBBS, MSHI  
**Healthcare Data Scientist | Physician | AI Scientist**  

As a **physician with advanced training in health informatics**, I have worked across the full spectrum of AI in medicine, from **clinical usability studies and workflow evaluation**, to **designing and training machine learning models**, and now **deploying AI solutions into real-world clinical environments**.  

My portfolio reflects both **clinical relevance** and **technical depth**:  
- **Imaging AI** – segmentation and quantitative analysis of MRI/CT for radiology workflows  
- **Predictive Modeling & NLP** – building models that anticipate outcomes and interpret clinical narratives  
- **System Deployment** – translating research into production-ready tools integrated with health data standards  

By approaching problems through the lens of both a **clinician and an AI scientist**, I ensure solutions are **medically meaningful, technically rigorous, and practically deployable**. My work demonstrates how AI can move beyond prototypes to **improve diagnostics, optimize decision-making, and support patient care**.
